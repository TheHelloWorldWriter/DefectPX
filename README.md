# DefectPX

DefectPX allows you to easily check for dead, stuck, or defective pixels.

Just change a few colors and test. Test monitors before purchasing. Test screens during the warranty period. Test anytime and anywhere.

DefectPX comes with both mouse and keyboard shortcuts, multi-monitor support, and a very intuitive interface. Free and open-source, portable, no installation required!
